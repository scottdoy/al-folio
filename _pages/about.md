I am an Assistant Professor of [Pathology and Anatomical Sciences](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/departments/pathology.html), [Biomedical Engineering](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/bme.html), and [Bioinformatics](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics.html) at the [University at Buffalo](http://buffalo.edu).
I received my BS and PhD in Biomedical Engineering from [Rutgers University](http://rutgers.edu) in 2011, then worked for a start-up company for two years before joining the faculty at UB. 
My lab focuses on computational pathology and radiology, using both traditional and deep learning for analyzing structural data (like images), and making decisions based on that data.
We focus more on application than on methods development, although we do some of that too.

I am part of the [Computational Cell Biology, Anatomy, and Pathology](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/departments/pathology/education/graduate/ccbap-phd.html) graduate program, which seeks to integrate computational tools and an engineering approach to solving problems in healthcare.
Our goal is to develop medical students and residents who know about artificial intelligence and statistical modeling -- And maybe even some programming!
