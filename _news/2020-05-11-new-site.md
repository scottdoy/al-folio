Ahoy!

This is the (third? second?) version of my website.
I typically set up a website at the beginning or end of the semester, and then immediately forget about it after a few days.
My hope for this version of the site is that it will contain a "notebook" of sorts for things that I find across the internet that help me work.

Hopefully, this time I will actually keep up with it!
